<!-- I never did Space Mountain or Autopia or Buzz Lightyear or Matterhorn. FUCK!-->
<p>May 14th - 18th, 2015 CAn Introduction to the Disney Arc, or The End of Part 1)</p>
<p>HOLY SHIT. What a vacation. Seriously, tour is something interesting. <!--The polar opposites that occured in a matter of
hours in range of emotion were absolutely incredible. Pure unfiltered happiness and enjoyment followed by crippling depression
and misery. --> I'm on the bus headed towards Hollywood right now (this bus driver is talking about several people chewing the
same piece of gum on the bus, IDK) and decided this will be the perfect time to write out this entire weekend in as much detail
as possible. I'll do each day in chunks. May 16th and 17th will probably be the most interesting and I will be writing
the days out without mention of the days to come so that my thought process still seems rational. I got to say though, this
is probably some of the most fun I have had in a long time! On top of that, there will be no talk of Reddit or Video Games, this is human. The POI will 
sometimes be refered to as She.</p>

<p>May 14th 2015</p>
<p>Today's the trip! Getting more excited I guess (trips have always been a hard thing for me, with all the stress that comes a long with it).
I'm writing this from my hotel room after a long-ass airplane ride sitting with [1-REDACTED] and [2-REDACTED]. I tried playing games,
and that didn't really work. I ended up just listening to music and not realizing that there was an outlet right in front
of me. Tried playing Mario Party DS with [2-REDACTED] but it didn't really work out too well. Hung out with [3-REDACTED] 
at the airport, played some weird pirate game where you have to act like you are rowing a boat on screen. I didn't win.
It's now me, [3-REDACTED], [4-REDACTED] and [5-REDACTED] all in this room getting ready to sleep (we are going to Disney
Land tomorrow!). We ended up staying at the airport and waiting a long time for the busses to arrive, so long in fact that
we were not able to get food or anything like that for the room. Sucks, but worth it. They didn't have an HDMI cord set up to there tv either,
so no Netflix for us :(. Maybe I can go pick one up tomorrow, I dunno. I'll have to see how this pans out. Well... I think that's it for today.
Nothing eventful happened on the plane. Nothing eventful happened earlier (except for [6-REDACTED] dancing like a mad man at the airport, geez
louise), and nothing eventful is going to happen tonight. So for tonight, Goodnight World, hello Disney! -Taiyo</p>

<p>May 15th 2015</p>
<p>Well today was... interesting. Rather depressing I would think from an outsiders perspective. Today was the first day at Disneyland and I spent it more or less
completely alone. I mean, for a first time alone at Disney Land I honestly had a lot of fun. I did the rides that I wanted to do, I went at my pace, got a burrito
at the plaza in FrontierLand, stuff like that. But for some reason, I wanted to be alone for it. I stayed alone for a good while until I bumped into [1-REDACTED]'s group,
and they invited me to get in line for StarTours with them. I joined in, and I honestly had a good bit of fun with them. They ended up having fast passes for Space
Mountain (which I will need to go on tomorrow) so I wandered off towards Thunder Mountain Railroad as we all just happened to have fast passes for it at the same time.
Around this time I also found somebody else's ticket on the ground and, I'm not really proud of this, ended up getting a fast pass for Space Mountain. Then I never went
on it. I feel kinda bad but oh wel`1l. I wandered over there, ended up bumping into [2-REDACTED], [3-REDACTED] and [4-REDACTED]. Stood in line with them for Beignets
(something from the Princess and the Frog apparently). Stayed there for about fifteen minutes then headed on over to Thunder Mountain. Having nothing to do, I
started copying over everybody's phone numbers from the itinerary that was provided by the choir teacher until [5-REDACTED] jumped out of line from his group and
started talking to me. We talked about video games and other things until [1-REDACTED]'s group came back. We went on the ride then went on Pirate's 
(I freaking love everything involving pirates) and just happened to bump into [6-REDACTED] and she joined our group. After Pirate's we all decided we wanted to get dinner
so we got permission to go over to Bubba Gump's and get some food. I wasn't really hungry so I got everyone some appetizers. After dinner, we Ubered to Target (even
though it was like right across the street) and I headed back to my room. Earlier today I had grabbed an HDMI cord and some water so I had Netflix now on the
hotel's tv (with a little bit of "hacking" involved where I pull a phone cord out of the tv). We are watching Pulp Fiction right now as I write this, so until
tomorrow, Goodnight World, hello competition tomorrow -Taiyo</p>

<p>May 16th 2015</p>
<p>I don't know where to begin. I'm equal parts mad at myself and ecstatic for myself...</p>
<p>I met a girl. She's fucking amazing. She's got an awesome personality and has several interests that align with mine, on top of that she's
fucking cute as hell. I think this could actually end up a relationship. She was really flirty back towards me (Fell into my lap when I pulled her in for a selfie 
with someone else, things like that). I know she dates as well so it won't be another [1-REDACTED] situation. She's a brunette with bleached blonde hair, 
she's about six inches shorter than me, the only thing that really could be a cause for concern would be she's 14 while I'm 17 (Freshman and Junior) but her birthday
is in [2-REDACTED] so it isn't that bad. I've actually had a small crush on her for awhile, as she is in the class before mine at [3-REDACTED] so this was me finally taking up on
an oppurtunity. While yes, this is breaking my Cardinal Rule, I think I can get past something as petty as that for her. Long story short, my Cardinal Rule is don't get
attached as it will only bring you pain and misery as evidenced by every single girl I have asked out first. Yeah, all my girlfriends they made the first move, 
not me. Let's start from the top.</p>
<p> We did the competition. I guess that's the point of this trip but honestly at this point it's an after thought. We get back to the hotel and I ask if I can
head over to [5-REDACTED] and [6-REDACTED]'s room to play Smash Brawl.
She's in the room. I play with them, talk to everyone a bit and she says she wants to go to Carl's Jr. I wanted food too so I tagged along. Eventually it was just me,
her and [4--REDACTED] walking over to Carl's Jr. I got to talking to her and if there was a list of things a girl should be then she hit basically everything. 
Interest in Zelda, watchs Adult Swim and shows like Loiter Squad and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. She laughs a lot. She was, in a word... astounding. It blew me away
how alike we were. There were several times where I was at a loss for words. We parted ways for DisneyLand and although I kept trying to meet up with her and Nick it
didn't work out until the ceremony. At the ceremony, I asked her to come sit with me and she did. And we talked. And we laughed, and she laughed and she laughed
and she laughed and she laughed and she laughed. It was glorious. I pulled her in for a selfie and she just fell into my lap. She also had rather pretty eyes so 
we were easily talking to each other. We went on a few more rides after that, I gave her my coat, she let me pull her along by her hand.... It was awesome.
Hadn't felt this way in... Honestly, I don't think I even felt this way with Taiga. It was an awesome night. I ended up walking with Nick and he told me that he's 
actually pretty decent friends with her and that she goes through something called "Day Phases" and that I should be careful. I mean, it was pretty obvious flirting.
Maybe I'll be the exception? That would be nice haha. Well, I'm writing this from my room as we are starting to watch Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and she still has
my coat (I got off the elevator, turned back and told her to just have it till tomorrow), so until tomorrow Goodnight World, hello potential! -Taiyo <3</p>

<p>May 17th 2015</p>
<p>I was wrong and stupid and right. I shouldn't have broiken the cardinal rule of mine, I knew I shouldn't have. Bad Tyler.
I can't write much right now but she basically ignored me as if nothing had happened yesterday. Nothing. </p>
<p>I was wrong</p>

<p>May 18th 2015</p>
<p>I couldn't write it out yesterday. I thought maybe I was wrong, but that was just denial.</p>
<p>She's a flirt.</p>
<p>I know that now.</p>
<p>Alright, from yesterday.</p>
<p>I woke up with anticipation, having dreamt something about her the night before. I do not remember the dream, only that I woke up with her on my mind.
I get all dressed up and ready to go to Magic Mountain and step out into the hallway to greet the other girls in the group of Brawlers I was playing with.
Talk with them for a bit then she comes and sits with us.</p>
<p>The way she talked to me... something was off.</p>
<p>I talk to her a bit more and follow them downstairs, and realize that I don't have any shoes so I cannot go with them to Denny's. I run upstairs and grab them and
end up having to bring [1-REDACTED] and [2-REDACTED] along with me. I think this is where it started going downhill. I talked more there, but the comfort that I was greeted
with the day before was absent. She seems disinterested. I backed off a bit, I knew that there might have been a bit of a chance. We head on to Magic Mountain. 
Not before she has the chance to ask me for an advil for back pain which I obliged to then she ran off. That made me rather unsettled.</p>
<p>I got there and joined there group. She would barely even look at me now, she was more interested in [3-REDACTED] now. I stayed with the group through the Tatsu and
through the line of the Ninja. While talking to [3-REDACTED] he dared me to ask him to leave and I did and he left. He always takes me by surprise he does. She begins
to look confused and then tells me that she is going after him to which I respond "Go". I sit in line with the rest of the group and then get offered the chance to jump
ahead in line. I take it. I don't want to be around these people any longer. I leave promptly and go to being alone.</p>
<p>I wander around for a short while. I tried an oxygen bar for the first time and still have the tube. It was kinda weird and it didn't really work too well on me, but
oh well. I tried a rock climbing wall that was there too and managed to pull both my thumb muscles (especially in my left arm). At this point I was basically done with 
the day. I wait around and end up with [4-REDACTED]'s group. We go on the Green Lantern and [4-REDACTED]'s phone flies out of her pocket on the last turn and bounces off the 
ground. Apparently I was laughing pretty hard, but most of that day was spent in a sad blur. We retrieve her phone and nothing happened to it, just the corner had a small chip.
Pretty miraculous. We then wait a bit, I go on the Wonder Woman Lasso ride then we head on home. I end up switching buses to the one that She was on, but She fell asleep
on it so it didn't matter. Worse, the guy she was following around barely even made an effort to flirt back, so I don't really understand her. After that we went back to 
the hotel, ordered a bunch of pizza and played Melee (if only I had know there was melee a couple doors down, I would have had a lot less interesting of a trip) with
[5-REDACTED] down the hall. We planned on sneaking over during the night to play more as the chaperones were really cracking down on curfew, but they ended up falling asleep.
We fell asleep in our room watching Netflix again.</p>
<p>And then it was today. I got up with 30 minutes until we had to depart for Hollywood, barely was able to pack and take a shower and be all ready to go. She still
had my coat too. I texted her the night before asking for it back but she never responded. I came downstairs to see her drop it on her violin so I scooped in and
grabbed it, no words were exchanged. I get on the 1st bus again and hang with [4-REDACTED] again, and we head to Hollywood. We get dropped off and I head straight to
In-N-Out for some grub. Bought a shirt too, I'll post an image later. I ended up with her group again somehow, but she joined later on. She was talking to me a bit more 
than yesterday, but null eye contact as compared to Saturday. She seemed to have a thing for [6-REDACTED] today which was rather apparent throughout the day. At least
now I was talking to her. Went around the mall place, took some photos for the group, saw a man in some great drag, truly got to understand what people mean about
guys trying to spread around their mixtapes. I parted ways from them later on due to random chance, and headed back to the bus. Off we went to Santa Monica beach which
I'm pretty sure is what made some of the environment for GTAV (pics later). I go with the theater kids group and head to the beach. At this point I was getting rather
thirsty so I ditch my shoes and take my backpack to look for a case of water. I don't find any. I walked around for over an hour and only brought back like six water
bottles (each a liter) that nobody really wanted. At this point She and her group were back and She was building a sand castle. I walked over and She asked me not to touch,
I reasurred her I wasn't then procceeded to watch her. She would comment on things I would do but wouldn't respond to any retorts or comments I had back. I ended up
making a turtle with sand (all pics later) and at that point the cube She was making was destroyed by the foot of [6-REDACTED]. They left and decided "screw it, I'm
meditating". I did the classic meditation stance until I finally decided to do Savasana on the beach. I did it for 30-60 minutes, I didn't really time. Then proceeded to 
try to sleep on my stomach for 10 or so minutes. After that, I followed [7-REDACTED] to the pier, offered a dollar to them so they could get a churro and they declined, then
wandered off back towards the beach and started the anger stage of grief. I had been depressed all day and now I was angry at myself for allowing this to happen and
at She for leading me on like she did. I tried to maintain the thought that Saturday was just a glimpse at what the future could hold but the perfect afternoon that I 
had had been a one time thing. I took pictures of the houses at this time because they were awesome too, bumped into [8-REDACTED] on a bike and headed up towards where the buses
would be. I got on the bus when it got here after passing out an entire case of Real Sugar Pepsi (I didn't get any :( ). We got the airport, I saw her looking my way
a couple times there but I headed off to get through the airport. I didn't get searched by security this time (I had left all liquids and my laptop in my backpack the 
last time), the guy made a joke about [1-REDACTED]'s face that was really funny and the caffeine was kicking in after a bus ride with a bathroom having a window right where
my penis was. I was acting very happy and energetic until we got on the airplane then continuted to act all cool and happy. Now, it's the airplane descent. I spent most
of the bus rides and airtime today writing all of this out so that I wouldn't forget. I don't mean to be in denial, but I still hope I can be friends with her as I will
be seeing her around a lot. She gave me her number, I could start there. We touch down in 20 minutes, I got my Batman cup that had Cola in it earlier, hid my laptop
under magazines tucked into the seat in front of me so I could charge other's phones, and just relaxed. Got my headphones half way through and rocked out to The Prodigy
and Fat Boy Slim. I hated all my friends earlier and now I am tired. I'm almost home, so let's see if what happens on tour really stays on tour.</p>
<p>This is where we will end part One of this blog (and whether or not I make that suicide note section), so Goodnight World, hello interesting girl that I hope I can
be friends with still! -Taiyo</p>

<p>Tomorrow is the trip, excited as always! More importantly, I believe that I mentioned the game that I was playtesting,
I might get to work on some dialogue for the game! Plus, I'll be mentioned in the game as well and maybe even see a little cash coming my way?
Hopefully this will work out better than [REDACTED] haha. The game is rather fun, I'll leave a link somewhere to a starting build.
And I did down there, I still don't know what the name is of it but it's certainly fun. I need to drop physics tomorrow, I
have an exam tomorrow in PreCalc (probably shouldn't be too bad) and I need to work on all my essay work for English. Great. 
Well, I think that's it for today. So... Goodnight world, hello dialogue! -Taiyo</p>

<p>May 12th 2015</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the last day that I was to carpool with G. So today was my first day bussing again! ... dammit, I just
got out of that too. I always do these too late, it's just past 1130 and I need to sleep very soon. Played Black Flag, 
had late night choir (will post links to songs I am doing tomorrow) and need to pay cashier block so I can drop physics. 
Songs - <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb4RwdrOO-8">Kalinda</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TacNIbmDZ4s">Ave Maris Stella</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Zqp0OpzMAI">Cloudburst</a></li>      
Choir trip in two days, super excited and I'm tired again so goodbye world, hello zzz ow my eye -Taiyo </p>


<p>May 10th 2015</p>
<p>I have not been able to upload to GitHub in awhile (need to fix that problem, GitHub won't load for me) so the website
is a bit behind. Yesterday I was out till like... 2 in the morning doing the cast party. It was pretty fun haha, we played
some Mafia and ended up buying $75 worth of Taco Bell (will get a copy of the reciept later). Also kissed [VOID] on the
hand yesterday on accident, but it was a sweet way to say goodbye. Anyways, I'm stalling as I got to finish this math hw
for tomorrow so Goodnight World, hello polynomials! -Taiyo </p>

<p>May 8th 2015</p>
<p>Today I playtested a game for another guy on reddit! I'll be saving the review on the game review section so that I can
have it saved somewhere.</p>


<p>May 7th 2015</p>
<p>Short today, it's 1:46 am and I'm tired and trying to make this routine. THeater went alright, dunno if dropping class
and I'm lonely. Goodnight world, hope for sleep <3 -Taiyo</p>

<p>May 6th 2015.</p>
<p>Holy shite I messed up. Big. Hopefully can rememdy tomorrow, but I just realized I left my freaking 3ds at school.
Fortunately for me I make sure to tuck it away in a box back stage where you'd have no reason to look (although there was
a group of girls that went through there... THANK GOODNESS I DIDN'T LEAVE MY CREDIT CARD INFO ON IT. Need to wake up
super early tomorrow to go retrieve it, planning on getting there when the jazz choir shows up. Ugh this is exactly what
I needed today, a reality check xD I wouldn't even have discovered it until much too late if I wasn't going to charge it
tonight. Now I know I need to be more careful. Besides that, today was rather uneventful. Quoted the Litany Against Fear
for warm ups in Theater and Dycus totally got the reference (and called the movie shite, how funny!). Left my DS at school
like an idiot, and did some more work into jeykll. Got a sweet docker sticker on my laptop (still doing work into that)
that I'll get a pic of at some point (need to work on links anyways). Now heading off to bed to watch some Subnautica with
IGP and not freak out over being a massive idiot. Goodnight world, hello Twilight! -Taiyo</p>


<p>May 5th 2015.</p>
<p>Still on part 12 of tutorial, will probably do more work tomorrow.</p>
<p>Well it's been a long day. Looking like I'll probably drop out of physics at the end of the week (thats no fun), choir trip is coming up
soon and my day of rest had a lot more work involved than I thought. But all in all, not a bad day. I got farther into Assassin's Creed:
Black Flag, I got some work done in my room, I finally got the Gardevoir portrait framed and on a higher note, I struck it BIG on reddit.
Like 2700 points big. Then two other comments at 50 something and 150 something points too. I guess the true treasure cove is maintained
over at /r/funny :). Elwirfy also got one over 100 point comment today, props to him as well! Besides all that, nothing too big happened
today, except that the person who caused my car accident wanted to claim certain charges on me (harrasment and stuff like that) for just asking for the necessary information
that of which we (G and I) needed in order to fill out the police accident report. That's not fun, but oh well. Time to head off to bed, 
or rather back to playing Black Flag for another hour as its 9:20pm right now and I have physics homework to finish (which I still am hesitant
to do as I plan to drop the class) so goodnight world, happy travels :D! - Taiyo</p>


<p>May 4th 2015.</p>
<p>I have started this blog today, spent about three hours setting up Jekyll, looking forward to seeing these results!</p>
<p>I'm going to bed, on part 12 of the tutorial on Jekyll by Thomas Bradley on Youtube, I'm pretty darn tired.
I've been working since... 6 pm? Somewhere around there, it's nearing 11 pm as I type this out so it's been nearly five hours.
I wonder if you can hit enter in a p-tag. Yup you can, it doesn't make much difference though haha.
But no, today I actually made steps towards accomplishing something! And as long as I keep this up, this could prove to be very
useful in the future. </p>
<p>On a more personal note, today I discovered that the General Prep Physics class I am taking is worthless, zilch, nada. Doesn't do a damn
thing for me degree and in some ways actually hinders it. I'm considering withdrawing at this point, but both of my parents are taking an
active part in my college life right now so it's more or less out of my hands right now. My other two classes are going fine though. Choir
field trip is coming up soon too! In just a couple weeks I'll be out to LA for the performance, hanging out with the other people, enjoying
the California sun. Should be a barrel of fun :D . I'm getting tired so I'll be cutting this short, but I've been watching IGP's Let's Play
of "Subnautica", which is basically underwater Minecraft. It looks super fun and I'd love to give it a shot at some point, but money evades
me for now. Anyways, I need to sleep now so goodnight world, hello slumber! - Taiyo</p>
