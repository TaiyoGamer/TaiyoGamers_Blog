<p>So ya tried the obvious one huh? Shame on you ;)</p>
<p>Well I'll have you know I'll try not to be too obvious with other secrets, so look for subtleties. Maybe mispelled words, maybe patterns of words being used, etc.</p>
<p>I have no plans, they sort of just come.</p>
<p>But let's start a pattern (okay not subtle, but won't be obvious unless you find these in order which you won't, although I hope luck is on your side because this hint probably won't be obvious, at least numerically... it will be a fun fact though haha ;)</p>

<h1>Fun Fact #2</h1>
