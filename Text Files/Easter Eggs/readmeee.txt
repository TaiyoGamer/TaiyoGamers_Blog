<p>I asked you to read me huh?</p>
<p>I'm sorry if that was far to obvious, I made that May 21st, 2015.</p>
<p>I created this blog about two weeks ago. I'm still thinking of things to do with this.</p>
<p>Although I still doubt anybody will ever care, but I just need to do this.</p>
<p>Well, I guess the point of this will be to reveal things about me.</p>
<p>In this one, since I was so needy with the asking, I would say that I've been told that my biggest problem when it comes 
to relationships will be that I will have trouble getting a second date.</p>
<p>I like to think I'm a pretty attractive person (dunno if I have revealed my sex yet so unless you already know I'll just keep it anonymous.)</p>
<p>In fact I get complimented all the time about my looks. I just have really low self esteem for some reason.</p>
<p>That's why I escape here. I should be doing homework, instead I am building this.</p>
<p>Oh well.</p>
<p>Cheers! I can promise you there will be no secrets on this page, but if you find this and didn't already know, this website has a ton of secret urls (or will eventually).
Find them all? Or some haha, I'm new to webdesign and I'm using Jekyll built on top of GitHub so yeah. Maybe I should set up this as a custom domain...</p>
<p>Well, Goodnight then World, hello future secret hunting! -Taiyo</p>
