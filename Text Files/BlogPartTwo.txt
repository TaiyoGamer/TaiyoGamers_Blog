<p>May 19th 2015</p>
<p>Today begins part two, but today also will be brief. I went to school, skipped some stupid standardized test at my high school,
came home, downloaded Pokemon Resolute (a very fun game btw) and then slept for six hours off some medication. I am at the
point where I start seeing her in other people, which is never fun. My guy friends think she is super hot, my lady friends
think she isn't so pretty and that I can do better. I don't have any goddamn standards of beauty, if I like a girl it's
a sixth sense sort of thing. I think I lost a few pounds on this trip. I'm tired. I'm miserable. I'll push through this.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah Goodnight World hello blah -Taiyo :/ </p>
