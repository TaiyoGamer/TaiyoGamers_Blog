<p>TFBF (don't know name, was a game that I playtested)</p>
<p>Here's my review.</p>
<p>Hey! Played it for about thirty minutes (boss fight was pretty hard, still haven't beaten it!) and do have a few things off the bat. First, if you could increase the size of the player's hitbox for selection that would be real helpful as there are times where I would try to select each guy and I couldn't find the sweet spot (the grayish area on Nimbus was a good director, maybe one of those on all of them?). Second, I don't know if I just missed the part but if you could in the tutorial explain the different items and abilities that would make it less confusing (or maybe when you click on a spell or item it pulls up a separate box that explains what the items do, I was able to figure out that Blue Bull was a mana potion and I think N20 was a haste potion? [although I didn't really see the affects of haste in battle]). Third, although this is a bit more nit-picky on my part, but if there could be an option to skip dialogue that'd also be nice. 

For bugs, it's still in the alpha phase, but there were a few that could be considered pretty important to fix. First off, if you hit escape any time during the battle it will reduce the window from full screen to windowed mode. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but after that it became very unreliable with registering clicks and I basically had to watch the characters die without being able to help. Second, the text that Bad Dad would give you during the battle would sometimes not show up at all (the bit about his weakness being water, any puns he would be making). Third, I don't know if this is actually a bug but some of Joe's spells didn't ever do anything (most on the second page that is). 

Less important bugs. During the character introduction screen, it stated that Nimbus had the ability Taunt that he could use, but taunt appeared to be a spell (which was unusable right now) and instead it was replaced with Imbue. There was a weird bug where if you would feed your character at the same time they were being attacked, if the attack would kill them they're sprite wouldn't disappear but they would still act as if they were dead. During my second play through all the numbers and quantities of items ceased to exist and I had to guess how many of each I had. The 8 strike foil never did more than one strike (maybe there was something you had to do and it was in the tutorial). The damage that Nimbus did with power strike seemed very random as well. Sam's attack was massively under powered compared to the other attacks the other characters could do. The slots were never fully explained either, extra explanation please. Cleaning up of sprites would be nice (that's just a detail though, all the sprites look fine). The special abilities present in the fight with kirby (or stuffinrough) I only was able to recreate with Nimbus, although that might just be a random event.
And that's all that immediately comes to mind. I'll continue trying to beat the boss later, but if you have any more questions feel free to ask away! -Taiyo</p>
