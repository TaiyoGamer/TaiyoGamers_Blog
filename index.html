<p>May 5th 2015.</p>
<p>Still on part 12 of tutorial, will probably do more work tomorrow.</p>
<p>Well it's been a long day. Looking like I'll probably drop out of physics at the end of the week (thats no fun), choir trip is coming up
soon and my day of rest had a lot more work involved than I thought. But all in all, not a bad day. I got farther into Assassin's Creed:
Black Flag, I got some work done in my room, I finally got the Gardevoir portrait framed and on a higher note, I struck it BIG on reddit.
Like 2700 points big. Then two other comments at 50 something and 150 something points too. I guess the true treasure cove is maintained
over at /r/funny :). Elwirfy also got one over 100 point comment today, props to him as well! Besides all that, nothing too big happened
today, except that the person who caused my car accident wanted to claim certain charges on me (harrasment and stuff like that) for just asking for the necessary information
that of which we (G and I) needed in order to fill out the police accident report. That's not fun, but oh well. Time to head off to bed, 
or rather back to playing Black Flag for another hour as its 9:20pm right now and I have physics homework to finish (which I still am hesitant
to do as I plan to drop the class) so goodnight world, happy travels :D! - Taiyo</p>


<p>May 4th 2015.</p>
<p>I have started this blog today, spent about three hours setting up Jekyll, looking forward to seeing these results!</p>
<p>I'm going to bed, on part 12 of the tutorial on Jekyll by Thomas Bradley on Youtube, I'm pretty darn tired.
I've been working since... 6 pm? Somewhere around there, it's nearing 11 pm as I type this out so it's been nearly five hours.
I wonder if you can hit enter in a p-tag. Yup you can, it doesn't make much difference though haha.
But no, today I actually made steps towards accomplishing something! And as long as I keep this up, this could prove to be very
useful in the future. </p>
<p>On a more personal note, today I discovered that the General Prep Physics class I am taking is worthless, zilch, nada. Doesn't do a damn
thing for me degree and in some ways actually hinders it. I'm considering withdrawing at this point, but both of my parents are taking an
active part in my college life right now so it's more or less out of my hands right now. My other two classes are going fine though. Choir
field trip is coming up soon too! In just a couple weeks I'll be out to LA for the performance, hanging out with the other people, enjoying
the California sun. Should be a barrel of fun :D . I'm getting tired so I'll be cutting this short, but I've been watching IGP's Let's Play
of "Subnautica", which is basically underwater Minecraft. It looks super fun and I'd love to give it a shot at some point, but money evades
me for now. Anyways, I need to sleep now so goodnight world, hello slumber! - Taiyo</p>
