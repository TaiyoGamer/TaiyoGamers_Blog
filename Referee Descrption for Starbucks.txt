On Sundays, I referee u7 and u8 games for Federal Way. My job is to insure that the field is set up, the boundaries are all in their correct spots and the goal is properly anchored as to not fall on the players. I meet the coaches and their teams, make sure all the players are wearing their proper equipment and have no dangerous materials on their body. During the game, I make sure the players understand the rules and play safely and fairly. I stop the game when people get hurt and have to watch the entire field constantly to make sure nothing dangerous or distracting enters the field.
