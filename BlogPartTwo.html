<p>June 22nd 2015</p>
<p>https://www.futureme.org. I wrote this out earlier today. I've been away for awhile, this made me realize that I need to write down my thoughts more often. So I'll
go back to doing this. Smells like a part three maybe coming soon enough!</p>
<p>Dear FutureMe,

This is the result of spending four hours now on both /r/horriblydepressing and http://www.whatisdeepfried.com/2001/01/10/stuffed-friend-4/ reading that comic. 

You realized today (or you've already really know and this is just another confirmation) that you have got depression. You sit here, unable to cry when you really want to.

You're 17. Today (or now, yesterday) was Father's Day, on Friday (two days ago yesterday on Father's Day) was Dad's birthday.

I hope he's doing alright. I recently found out he is on anti-depressants from mom. 

You realized earlier this week that your best friend (Riley Wirfs) is basically a rapist. You've know for awhile but you've just refused to acknowledge it. You wanted a friend, and even though he really didn't care too much anyways, he gave you time to talk about anything you wanted to.

I'm jumping around from you to I so bear with me, it's three in the morning on June 22nd right now, 2015.

I don't think I did so well grades wise this last quarter at Highline college. They really probably weren't too good.

I just stopped caring, about anything.

I've been lonely recently, wanting a girlfriend but never having any of the courage/ want to really look hinders you. 

I haven't dated my last serious girlfriend (Michelle Pyles) since September 21st, 2013. Nearly two years.

I always feel bad whenever I feel bad about myself. It's probably half the reason why I don't ever bother trying to get any sort of help.

Makes me feel like a burden on everyone else.

When I want to be the strong one for everyone else. 

These feelings...

They come in waves.

And that can sometimes be the worst part. 

Because at one moment I'm weak and tired and lonely.

The next I don't feel it anymore.

I don't feel anything anymore.

And those lies... Are more confusing than any abstract thought or idea I can encounter.

Before I forget, recently I wrote an equation for Java (probably real outdated by now)

Here it is:
 public class HelloWorld { //(previously multiplyNineWithoutMultiplyingByNine or HelloWorld)
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      for(double a = 0.0; a < 10; a++) { //Integer.MAX_VALUE and 1/Integer.MAX_VALUE
         double b = a % 10;
            double e = Math.floor(b) + 1;
            double g = a - e; /// could I do g = a - e + 1; ? replaced f with e
            double h = 10 * g;
            double j = e * 10 - a; // could I do j = f * 10 - a; ? instead of i also replaced f with e worked
                System.out.println((h + j) + "-- my equation vs actual multiplication -- " + (a * 9) );  //try taking out k and just have h + j 
      }}}

All that integer stuff, that's to prove it.

I could write in this forever, I don't know what I'll want to hear from myself in the future. 

If I make it. I hope I do.

Hope.

I scoff at this in passing, yet I secretly cling to it.

Why don't I let myself open up anymore. 

I try. I talk to others sometimes. I'm afraid of what they'll think.

I like to think my life has been pretty good, good and average teen boy life.

I do Theater work and I get (well not recently) good grades.

And yet I look back at my life...

I wore a cast for a year when I got severe burns on my arm and head when I was two-three. 

I got kicked out of whatever camp because I didn't know proper etiquette (I changed my pants outside, I didn't see the problem but it got me kicked out).

I moved states halfway through third grade. 

Was bullied throughout third and fourth grade.

Was the weird kid in fifth grade, none of those friends (except for just a few have stuck around at all).

Physically bullied in sixth grade ended up in court.

Became a social pariah through seventh and most of eighth grade, when in the end I said "fuck it" and changed high schools to TAF.

Bad decision.

You don't know what you have until its gone huh.

Went back to the regular high school in Tenth grade, easily one of the best decisions I made.

Then I decided to go to college. 

The balancing was good and it worked out well.

Now I'm here.

I'm a senior now.

I'm being pushed to go to college, but I can't even make goals for something twelve hours ahead, compared to something twelve months ahead.

Recently, because of Referee work, I've been able to buy a bunch of steam games and MTG cards because of sales/friends wanting to go out.

Just thought I'd add that in there.

I'm scared.

I'm going to send this out multiple times if I can. Once a year, on my birthday.

Depressing isn't it? Or a source of strength?

You've made it this far. Even if you have nothing inside of you that pushes you, remember that you're doing this not for you, but for everyone else around you.

Keep making people happy.

I hate to see this end. But I guess that has to happen.

I've tried keeping diaries, but they always go on the wayside. 

Maybe I'll go update my blog with this, I've been gone awhile.

You'll remember it.

I need to wrap up, I've been writing for half an hour now.

If no one else says it, you're love will have to make up for it. 

Love everything and everyone else as best you can.

Hopefully one day you'll feel that same love (excluding family) back.</p>

<p>Been away. More later. Humble Bundle, check it out.</p>

<p>3NWHAHT7JYTY Free code for NBA jam on istore</p>
<p>Dream 1, our Choir went to perform and Gorringe, I and other students end up having to take something from the guy in charge but he's like a fairytail-esque wizard. Jumped off ledges that were really high several times, it was kind of like a spy thing. At one point, Dexter does an interview downstairs in the foyer/ballroom that kind of looked like an ice rink but dark and there were a lot of people there. 
Dream 2, playing tag with people at a house and one of them is a wolf and I end up evading him for a long time, jumping off high places and running for my life just narrowly missing him several times. I climbed through an attic, jumped off the roof, closed doors so he had to find other ways, hid in places so he couldn't find me. 


<h2>May 22nd 2015</h2>
<p>I'm doing this early today because I got a headache and can hardly focus. Ugh... Can't even focus on homework and on top of that
I still got PreCalc 1 to go to in an hour...</p>
<p>Damn I'm tired.</p> 
<p>I'm always tired, I don't quite no why. I just am.</p>
<p>I sleep well. Well, moderately. Maybe average 6-8 hours a night?</p>
<p>Shouldn't that be enough? Or is this something more metaphysicsal?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Today, the girl that hit me with her car was parked outside my house. I don't know if I ever talked about this but I was hit my a car a few weeks ago, still haven't fully recovered.</p>
<p>It comes in waves, that's what muscle spasms are.</p>
<p>Like the white whale analogy from yesterday.</p>
<p>Reddit is also down right now which is why I'm doing this now as well xD</p>
<p>I wonder if Jekyll supports Javascript...</p>
<p>Anyways, these blogs posts have started getting a lot more drawn out, each sentence more or less having it's own line. I wonder if that's better, I mean in theory it should make it a lot easier to read.</p>
<p>I'm still making the blog better over time too, so this may just turn into a little project for me.</p>
<p>I got a 91.5 on my math test ^^</p>

<h3>Later that day...</h3>
<p>I got Pokemon Art Academy ^-^, I'll post a review of it later, a before or after sort of thing haha. So far it's pretty fun actually, 
and if I wasn't so tired I would go back and do more of it.</p>
<p>I don't know why I'm so tired, it's only 8:45pm. At least I don't have to work this weekend, nor do I have anything going on tomorrow.</p>
<p>Life can be hard man. I got about three thousand words I gotta write this weekend that I am totally looking forward to haha.</p>
<p>Why am I so tired? Seriously, what did I do today? College, high school, hooked R up with some nerf guns, then played ACIV for a few hours.
Got tired of that and turned on Netflix, specifically The Office; turned on IGP on my laptop (youtube was really laggy for some reason) and started playing Pokemon Art Academy. Now I'm here.</p>
<p>I need to start excercising more. I'm not very fit and it's starting to show :( I just need some sort of motivator... An excercise app that records the time doing excercise and has your character actually grow alongside you in the game... I wonder if that exists.</p>
<p>I tried a new hot sauce today, two actually. Ass-Kicking Sriracha (yes that's the name) and Habanero Hot Sauce from Hell "Devil's Revenge". The first one I could handle, the second was a bit of a trip. Only lasted a few minutes but it was still a rush.</p>
<p>I don't want to do anything right now. That makes me sad, but there's nothing I can do about it. Where's my motivation? Where's my drive? Is it normal to have those, cause I don't.</p>
<p>You know, that girl I had that thing with on Saturday, I don't even really think she was my type. I mean, looking back she's kind of an attention whore...</p>
<p>Who am I kidding. I don't have a type.</p>
<p>I don't understand attraction.</p>
<p>Literally.</p>
<p>I'm not attracted to people. Well, not normally. It's rather hard to explain, it's sort of like a sixth sense (yes I just watched that movie a few days ago and I really liked it :) ).</p>
<p>When I say looks aren't important to me, I mean that. But it doesn't mean that I'll go date some chick that I find unattractive. I have never really been attracted to somebody primarily for looks. A couple times maybe, that's it.</p>
<p>I can't just like somebody. Every person I have ever liked was just some fluke. The first time I looked at them I thought they were attractive. People just don't grow on me.</p>
<p>Another thing like that, whenever I'm with a group of guys I change the way I look at women. The way they always describe women, "nice butt, boobs, etc" I always force myself to think like that. I don't think like that at all. Hell, I hardly even notice those features for the most part when I first see a woman.
I always see their eyes. That's where I look for, their eyes, their face. That's what I notice, that's what tells the story. Unless those features are like super obvious (they're huge/super skinny), I won't notice them until I attempt to court them (if I try).</p>
<p>People I like always have certain characteristics. Nerdy (not super nerdy, I'm talking LoZ and other nintendo things), 
opinionated, strong, courageous. Alphas/Strong Betas. The ones that will actually be interesting.</p>
<p>That's my problem. I don't pay attention to anything unless it interests me. I can't, it bores me.</p>
<p>The girl from Saturday interested me, she fit most of the characteristics. If you fit those, you're more or less automatically interesting.
But besides that, laughing helps (from them). Also... I dunno. It's a case by case basis. If somebody isn't interesting the first time I meet them, I won't be interested.</p>
<p>I don't know if I'm demisexual, asexual, or something else. I'm not very interested in sex, nor would I ever do anything with a random girl (I tried it once, I didn't enjoy it, but that's another story for another day).</p>
<p>Sex is weird.</p>
<p>Not that I haven't been educated, I would say I've had a pretty decent education (be it from me or others).</p>
<p>*sigh*...</p>
<p>I've been typing for half an hour now. I think it's time to call it.</p>
<p>Goodnight World, hello confused sexuality -Taiyo</p>

<h2>May 21st 2015</h2>
<p>I skipped choir today. Not on purpose, I just couldn't make it today. I still have that plaque (will get a good picture with it soon), and
the only other thing that happened today is that the test I took last week was apparently missing a page so I had to go take it and skip choir.<p>
<p>Also, Stacks has a damn good milkshake. Too bad it's like five bucks (insert Pulp Fiction quote).</p>
<p>Rocking out to the remastered edition of Californication. Also, want cheap noise cancelling headphones? Take headphones that go over your ears,
and wear ear buds. The sound comes through fine and that's all I can hear, it's all vibrations dude (I hope I'm not breaking my ears)...</p>
<p>My ears hurt.</p>
<p>Alright I took them out... geez.</p>
<p>Hmm... I wanna take a more philosophical approach to this as well, incorporating the diary/blog into a playground for my thoughts.</p>
<p>I need to figure out how to set up a comment section...</p>
<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>I'm starting to pull away from the thoughts of her.</p>
<p>You know what's funny? Course you don't I haven't told, that's a stupid question.</p>
<p>I define most of my periods of my life by who I was interested in/dating/courting.</p>
<p>It's as if I am dependent on others to feel "human".</p>
<p>I got pretty bad depression, I'll be honest.</p>
<p>Dunno if I've not said that.</p>
<p>But I do. And it affects me. I mean, I get bouts of sadness, but everyday just feeling like nothing really matters anyways so why do I try so hard...</p>
<p>Do other people do this? Define their lives by those around them?</p>
<p>I dunno if this is really beta-ish, because I usually consider myself an Alpha personality type.</p>
<p>Let's see... as far as I remember...</p>
<p>I've gone through approximately <!--Lauren, Alex, Yelena+Sam+Anna, Tori, Assorted, Taiga, Tori, Alex, "Flings", Tori, Highline, Ryley. --> Twelve phases.</p>
<p>If you knew what the phases were you would notice a lot of the same person showing up.</p>
<p>I had this unhealthy crush on another girl for a long time. Several years in fact. I could just never really talk to her. I finally asked for her number in 8th grade at one point and she said no, the next year I went to a "special" high school.</p>
<p>Fuck that high school man, it was not a good fit for me. So I went back to the regular high school.</p>
<p>And then we did the same extra-curricular activities.</p>
<p>GODDAMMIT.</p>
<p>Then, I was dating someone else so it was okay. And we broke up.</p>
<p>And much like cigarretes, I went back.</p>
<p>And I found something else that would help distract. Didn't last.</p>
<p>I was addicted. I am addicted.</p>
<p>And I can't stop myself.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in recent times I have gotten a bit better about it, and hell, I even told her at one point to see if it would help.</p>
<h1>NOPE</h1>
<p>So I deal with it. It will come back, it goes in waves.</p>
<p>My life is like a castaway, desparately looking for land but keep turning up mirages.</p>
<p>And then that damned white whale comes back all the time and rips apart any fantasies I build to protect me.</p> <!--I hope Ishmael doesn't kill Moby.-->
<p>Oh well.</p>

<p>I'm getting to the point where I can write for hours... But I'll cut it off here today. Goodnight world, hello oceans of madness -Taiyo</p>



<h2>May 20th 2015</h2>
<p>Nothing happened today. Didn't have choir. Didn't have any tests. Just had school, ACIV and Reddit (also Pokemon Resolute).
Thoughts are creeping into my mind all the time, but I honestly am conflicted. Do I try to go for the friend position?
Is it too late? Will it be bad? I don't know, but I'll probably pass by her tomorrow... That thought pains me. </p>
<p>A lot of this pains me right now.</p>
<p>*sigh*...</p>
<p>:/</p>
<p>We humans really need love in our lives huh?</p>
<p>Love would be nice.</p>
<p>It's far better than depression.</p>
<p>I had love once. It was a long time ago. I don't think I ever talked about it on here.</p>
<p>No, I mentioned her earlier. Taiga.</p>
<p>Where do you think I got this name from huh?</p>
<p>She gave me it. I always liked it, so I adopted it myself. It might have been her nickname for me, but like the Christian
Cross and the word "nigga", I reclaimed it for myself, made it a sense of power.</p>
<p>Taiyo is part of who I am now.</p>
<p>Thank you Taiga.</p>
<p>But I digress...</p>
<p>We all need love. It doens't matter where it comes from. Straight, Gay, Lesbian, Pansexual, Demisexual, Asexual, who
gives a shit where it comes from. People need what they need.</p>
<p>That's why I still feel pain.</p>
<p>I'm a rather shy person. If you knew me, it wouldn't seem that way, but it takes a lot of courage just to walk up to
somebody I know and say hi.</p>
<p>To have somebody who I could so easily connect with just... use me for their own personal desires is horrible.</p>
<p>Painful.</p>
<p>Heh, I'm watching Last Week Tonight on Youtube right now. I'll drop a link down there to the one I am currently watching. It's
about standardized testing, which I agree is absolute bullshit.</p>
<p>Those who are close to me, I apologize if any of this upsets you or angers you, I really just need to get these thoughts
down.</p>
<p>I need a hug. But not from those around me. From someone new.</p>
<p>It's exciting.</p>
<p>It's new.</p>
<p>It's not me.</p>
<p>It's hard being yourself.</p>
<p>Especially when you don't like yourself all the time.</p>
<p>Especially when you don't like everyone around you all the time.</p>
<p>Especially when you're alone.</p>
<p>I'm going rather far for a blog post... I'll move over to thoughts. For now, Goodnight World, hello thoughts. -Taiyo-kun</p>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhKAQX5izw">Last Week Tonight: Standardized Testing</a></li>

<p>May 19th 2015</p>
<p>Today begins part two, but today also will be brief. I went to school, skipped some stupid standardized test at my high school,
came home, downloaded Pokemon Resolute (a very fun game btw) and then slept for six hours off some medication. I am at the
point where I start seeing her in other people, which is never fun. My guy friends think she is super hot, my lady friends
think she isn't so pretty and that I can do better. I don't have any goddamn standards of beauty, if I like a girl it's
a sixth sense sort of thing. I think I lost a few pounds on this trip. I'm tired. I'm miserable. I'll push through this.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah Goodnight World hello blah -Taiyo :/ </p>
