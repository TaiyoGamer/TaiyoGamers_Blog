<p>May 20th 2015</p>
<p>Nothing happened today. Didn't have choir. Didn't have any tests. Just had school, ACIV and Reddit (also Pokemon Resolute).
Thoughts are creeping into my mind all the time, but I honestly am conflicted. Do I try to go for the friend position?
Is it too late? Will it be bad? I don't know, but I'll probably pass by her tomorrow... That thought pains me. </p>
<p>A lot of this pains me right now.</p>
<p>*sigh*...</p>
<p>:/</p>
<p>We humans really need love in our lives huh?</p>
<p>Love would be nice.</p>
<p>It's far better than depression.</p>
<p>I had love once. It was a long time ago. I don't think I ever talked about it on here.</p>
<p>No, I mentioned her earlier. Taiga.</p>
<p>Where do you think I got this name from huh?</p>
<p>She gave me it. I always liked it, so I adopted it myself. It might have been her nickname for me, but like the Christian
Cross and the word "nigga", I reclaimed it for myself, made it a sense of power.</p>
<p>Taiyo is part of who I am now.</p>
<p>Thank you Taiga.</p>
<p>But I digress...</p>
<p>We all need love. It doens't matter where it comes from. Straight, Gay, Lesbian, Pansexual, Demisexual, Asexual, who
gives a shit where it comes from. People need what they need.</p>
<p>That's why I still feel pain.</p>
<p>I'm a rather shy person. If you knew me, it wouldn't seem that way, but it takes a lot of courage just to walk up to
somebody I know and say hi.</p>
<p>To have somebody who I could so easily connect with just... use me for their own personal desires is horrible.</p>
<p>Painful.</p>
<p>Heh, I'm watching Last Week Tonight on Youtube right now. I'll drop a link down there to the one I am currently watching. It's
about standardized testing, which I agree is absolute bullshit.</p>
<p>Those who are close to me, I apologize if any of this upsets you or angers you, I really just need to get these thoughts
down.</p>
<p>I need a hug. But not from those around me. From someone new.</p>
<p>It's exciting.</p>
<p>It's new.</p>
<p>It's not me.</p>
<p>It's hard being yourself.</p>
<p>Especially when you don't like yourself all the time.</p>
<p>Especially when you don't like everyone around you all the time.</p>
<p>Especially when you're alone.</p>
<p>I'm going rather far for a blog post... I'll move over to thoughts. For now, Goodnight World, hello thoughts. -Taiyo-kun</p>

<p>May 19th 2015</p>
<p>Today begins part two, but today also will be brief. I went to school, skipped some stupid standardized test at my high school,
came home, downloaded Pokemon Resolute (a very fun game btw) and then slept for six hours off some medication. I am at the
point where I start seeing her in other people, which is never fun. My guy friends think she is super hot, my lady friends
think she isn't so pretty and that I can do better. I don't have any goddamn standards of beauty, if I like a girl it's
a sixth sense sort of thing. I think I lost a few pounds on this trip. I'm tired. I'm miserable. I'll push through this.
Blah blah blah blah blah blah Goodnight World hello blah -Taiyo :/ </p>
