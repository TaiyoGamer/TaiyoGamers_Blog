<p>Well something happened, I hope everything is okay...</p>
<p>Earlier I was going on some sort of tirade.. I don't really know...</p>
<p>I still have soreness.</p>
<p>I'm still sad.</p>
<p>But I'll be fine.</p>
<p>My best friend laughed at me because of all this.</p>
<p>He compared it to his "PTSD" as due to a "Nerf War" he was participating in.</p>
<p>You heard me, Nerf guns.</p>
<p>That really depressed me.</p>
<p>You're friends are supposed to be there for you when you're sad and/or hurt.</p>
<p>I mean dude, seriously? What the actual fuck.</p>
<p>I can't face you in person so I write this shit here. The downside is that you always read this right alongside me.</p>
<p>If you read this and laugh, fuck you.</p>
<p>If you read this and actually listen, don't talk about this.</p>
<p>I already know.</p>
<p>Wait till the end of school to bring it up if you want to.</p>
<p>Doesn't need to happen, I doubt you will remember anyways.</p>
<p>I'm going to bed. Goodnight. -Taiyo</p>

<p>Random thoughts I guess? That could be the point of this. Right now, I'm just tired. I've a lot of shite going on this
week, I got theater ending this week, college is starting to catch up to me, I've still got whiplash, the person who gave
me the whiplash is being rather shifty when it comes to that as well... I'm just bored. I'm thinking of playing around 
this website. maybe a game... hmm... If there were to be any hints, I'd think that I'm so meta, even this acronym. ;)
Happy Hunting! -Taiyo </p>
