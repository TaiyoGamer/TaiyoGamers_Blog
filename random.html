<p>May 6th, 6:56pm</p>
<p>Random thoughts I guess? That could be the point of this. Right now, I'm just tired. I've a lot of shite going on this
week, I got theater ending this week, college is starting to catch up to me, I've still got whiplash, the person who gave
me the whiplash is being rather shifty when it comes to that as well... I'm just bored. I'm thinking of playing around 
this website. maybe a game... hmm... If there were to be any hints, I'd think that I'm so meta, even this acronym. ;)
