<p>Hey, how'd you find me?</p>
<p>Nobody should have found me.</p>
<p>Nobody will probably every find me.</p>
<p>I'm not important, I'm just a kid.</p>
<p>But I haven't been very specific about who I am.</p>
<p>My name is Taiyo.</p>
<p>I am Tyler.</p>
<p>My last name, which for privacy will be kept secretive, is how people know me.</p>
<p>Three different people, all me.</p>
<p>I was my last name for a very long time.</p>
<p>Most people don't know the true me.</p>
<p>Everywhere else, I play Taiyo.</p>
<p>I'm an actor.</p>
<p>A bit of an artist.</p>
<p>And I am willing to let people know a bit more about me.</p>
<p>Any an all questions may be sent to taiysishikawa@gmail.com</p>
<p>This is a spare email, it means literally nothing.</p>
<p>But if anyone takes the time to find this and actually gives a shit, shoot me an email.</p>
<p>I'll see it.</p>
<p>Sincerly, Tyler, May 20th, 2015</p>
